## 1. Frequent Reminders
The web app should be able to send mails (or text messages) frequently to the logged in user reminding him of his goals.

## 2. Duration of Goals
Goals can be set goals for weekly, monthly and yearly. If weekly, reminders can be just twice, if monthly, 8, and if  yearly, between 40 and 60 reminders.
> Apart from the regular durations, users can just set single goals, and include a deadline. 

## 3. Deadline Count
The app would also show remaining number of days for deadline.

## 4. Public vs Private Status
Users can choose to work on the application publicly or privately.
If public, some of his details (such as profile, number of goals, etc) would be shown in a general list (containing other public users).
If private, none of his details would be displayed elsewhere.

## 5. Social Media Publishing
A social media button such as twitter would be enabled on the application where the user can share his goals as he creates them or when successful.
- If Automatic Social Media Publishing is enabled, the user would not need to manually share these things.

## 6. Homepage
Welcome screen, testimonials, login, register and footer.

## 7. PWA
The Web application would be a progressive web application for now for easily installing. Future hopes, that it would be integrated as a mobile application.

## 8. Comment Routine
As time goes on, the user would be able to commit to a routine of commenting his progress. e.g Weekly, he'll keep making regular comments of what he was able to do in respect to achieving his goals.

## 9. Goal Limits
A limit would be defined for setting goals. The aim of this application is to keep the user focused, so having too many goals to achieve could be distracting.

#### For Regular Goals - Weekly, Monthly, Yearly
* Weekly Goals - Limit - 3
* Monthly Goals - Limit - 8
* Yearly Goals - Limit - 15

#### For irregular Goals - One time (with deadline)
* Two goals maximum can be set before the same timeline. e.g If a goal was set to finish a project before 30th June as deadline, another goal can be set to build a house before 30th June (or lower) as deadline, but a third goal cannot be set within this same timeline.
* In little contrast to the point above, goals may have longer timelines so setting a limit of 2 may not be appropriate. In this regard, timelines would be calculated. The smaller the timeline, maximum of 2 goals can be set, the longer the timeline, more than 2 goals can be set.

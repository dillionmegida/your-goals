1. The web app should be able to send mails frequently to the logged in user reminding him of his goals.
2. Goals can be set for weekly and monthly. Later, we could add yearly. If weekly, reminder can be just twice, if monthly, 8 email notifications.
3. Apart from weekly and monthly, users can just set single goals, and include a deadline. 
4. The app could also show remaining number of days for deadline.

This is all for now, I will keep updating more.
